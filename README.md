## Unified Brax and Mujoco Playground 
This is for a class project where we are investigating a method to explicitly predict Privileged Information by modifying the Brax implementation of SAC and visualizing and managing enviroments with Mujoco Playground

## Install Instructions

* then cd into brax and do uv pip install -e .
* then do the rest of the mujoco playground install insctrictions 


## Ordered TO-DO :x: :white_check_mark:
* Implement Self-Attention netowrks :x:
* Calculate loss :x:
* Test with g1 locomotion task -- already has domain randimization :x:
* dm_control domain randimization :x:
  
### REF 
* for domain ranimization see locomotion for g1 as example
